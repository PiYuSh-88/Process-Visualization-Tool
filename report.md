## Appendix

### A. AI-Generated Project Elaboration/Breakdown Report
The Process Visualization Tool is a sophisticated web application that bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms. The project is structured into three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Interactive web interface
   - Real-time visualization components
   - User input handling
   - Dynamic updates via WebSocket

2. **Application Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket event handling
   - State management
   - Process scheduling logic

3. **Core Layer**
   - Process data structures
   - Scheduling algorithm implementations
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - State transitions

### B. Problem Statement
The Process Visualization Tool addresses the following challenges:
1. Difficulty in understanding complex CPU scheduling algorithms through static diagrams
2. Lack of interactive tools for learning and teaching operating system concepts
3. Need for real-time visualization of process execution
4. Requirement for comparing different scheduling algorithms
5. Necessity of practical experience in process management and scheduling

The tool provides an intuitive interface for users to:
- Visualize process execution in real-time
